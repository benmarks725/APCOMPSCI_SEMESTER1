getResponse()
Did you finish the code? 
If so…
Copy and paste your code here
public String getResponse(String statement)
	{
		String response = "";
		if (statement.length() == 0)
		{
			response = "Say something, please.";
		}
		if (findKeyword(statement, " no ") >= 0 || findKeyword(statement, " not ") >= 0 || findKeyword(statement, "n't") >= 0)
		{
			response = "Why so negative?";
		}
		else if (findKeyword(statement, "mother") >= 0
				|| findKeyword(statement, "father") >= 0
				|| findKeyword(statement, "sister") >= 0
				|| findKeyword(statement, "brother") >= 0)
		{
			response = "Tell me more about your family.";
		}
How similar is your code to the one provided?
My code is pretty similar to the one provided but I have added some more parameters to return the "Why so negative response" 
Is your code more or less efficient?
My code is more efficient because I entered spaces before and after the word "no" so it only returns that response for the word no by itself.
What could you have done differently?
There's not much I could have done differently as my code is already fairly efficient.
What did you learn from comparing your code to the provided answer?
I learned that generally how chatbots are created using a series of if statements with parameters.

findKeyword()
Did you finish the code? 
If so…
Copy and paste your code here
private int findKeyword(String statement, String goal, int startPos)
	{
			String phrase = statement;
			goal = goal.toLowerCase();
			phrase = statement.trim().toLowerCase();
			int psn = phrase.indexOf(goal, startPos);
		while(psn >= 0)
		{
			String before = "";
			String after = "";
			if (psn > 0)
			{
				before = phrase.substring(psn-1, psn);
			}
			if (psn + goal.length() < phrase.length())
			{
				after = phrase.substring(psn + goal.length(), psn + 1 + goal.length());	
			}
			if ((before.compareTo("a") < 0 || before.compareTo("z") > 0) && (after.compareTo("a") < 0 || after.compareTo("z") > 0))
			{		
				return psn;
			}
			psn = phrase.indexOf(goal, psn+1);
		}
		return -1;
	}
	private int findKeyword(String statement, String goal)
	{
		return findKeyword(statement, goal, 0);
	}
How similar is your code to the one provided?
My code is very similar to the one provided except for a few minor differences.
Is your code more or less efficient?
My code is less efficient because I could have declared the String phrase in one line rather than two lines.
What could you have done differently?
I couldn't have done too much differently except for being more efficient in the declarations.
What did you learn from comparing your code to the provided answer? 
I learned that you can instantiate variables in while loops.

Exercise_03
Paste your code here and explain how it works.

else if (findKeyword(statement, ("cat")) >= 0
		 || findKeyword(statement, ("dog")) >= 0
		 || findKeyword(statement, ("fish")) >= 0
		 || findKeyword(statement, ("turtle")) >= 0)
		 {
			 response = "Tell me more about your pet.";
		 }			
		else if (findKeyword(statement, "Robinette") >= 0)
		{
			response = "He sounds like a pretty dank teacher.";
		}
		else
		{
			response = getRandomResponse();
		}
		return response;
	}
The code takes the parameters of the word in the parentheses you want to find and plugs it into the findKeyword method. If findKeyword returns a value greater than -1, the desired response is printed.

transformIWantStatement()
Did you finish the code? 
If so…
Copy and paste your code here
private String transformIWantToStatement(String statement)
	{
	   statement = statement.trim();
	   String lastChar = statement.substring(statement.length()-1);
	   if (lastChar.equals("."))
	   {
		   statement = statement.substring(0, statement.length()-1);
	   }
	   int psn = findKeyword(statement, "i want to");
	   String restOfStatement = "";
	   if(psn > -1)
	   {
		   restOfStatement = statement.substring(psn + 9);
	   }
	   return "What would it mean to" + restOfStatement;
	}
How similar is your code to the one provided?
My code is pretty similar to the one provided but I have an extra if statement.
Is your code more or less efficient?
My code is less efficient than the one provided because I have an extra if statement.
What could you have done differently?
I could have condensed my code by adding 0 in the findkeyword method to make my code more efficient.
What did you learn from comparing your code to the provided 
answer?
I learned how to complete the transformIwanttostatement more efficiently.

transformYouMeStatement()
Did you finish the code? 
If so…
Copy and paste your code here
private String transformYouMeStatement(String statement)
	{
	   statement = statement.trim();
	   String lastChar = statement.substring(statement.length()-1);
	   if (lastChar.equals("."))
	   {
		   statement = statement.substring(0, statement.length()-2);
	   }
	   int psnYou = findKeyword(statement, "you");
	   int psnMe = findKeyword(statement, "me", psnYou + 3);
	   String restOfStatement = "";
	   if(psnYou > -1)
			restOfStatement = statement.substring(psnYou + 3, psnMe);
	   
	   return "What makes you think that I" + restOfStatement + "you?";
	}
 How similar is your code to the one provided?
My code is fairly similar to the one provided with a few minor differences in the if statement and the variable intpsnOfYou.
Is your code more or less efficient?
My code isn't really more or less efficient but performs the same task.
What could you have done differently?
I couldn't have done much different as my code works and compiles and runs.
What did you learn from comparing your code to the provided 
answer?
I learned that I correctly completed the transformYouMeStatement.
